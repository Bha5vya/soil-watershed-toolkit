# Soil & Watershed Toolkit

Micro geospatial decision-support tools for soil erosion, runoff, and watershed management using GIS and remote sensing.

This repository contains a collection of small, focused geospatial models and indices designed to support preliminary watershed assessment and conservation planning.

Each folder inside this repository represents an independent mini-project.

---

## Objectives

- Identify erosion-prone and hydrologically sensitive areas
- Support prioritization of soil and water conservation measures
- Demonstrate practical applications of GIS and remote sensing for watershed analysis
- Build a reproducible geospatial research portfolio

## Each mini-project contains:
- scripts/ → source code (GEE / Python / GIS)
- outputs/ → maps and results
- README.md → project explanation

## Current Projects

- Micro Erosion Hotspot Index (MEHI)  
  Identifies relative soil erosion susceptibility using slope, NDVI, and rainfall.

(More tools will be added)

## Tools & Platforms

- Google Earth Engine  
- QGIS  
- Remote sensing datasets (Sentinel, MODIS, CHIRPS, SRTM)
